# Tools, binaries and scripts

The main serving, diagnostic and validation commands are listed below.
The server is `dgpp-serve`, launched by `scripts/dgpp-cluster`. `tools/` holds the Python
checkpoint and reference tooling the tests use; `scripts/` holds the fabric
and serving operations. `docs/benchmarks.md` says which of these produced
each published number, and how to run them in the right order.

The Bash scripts handle process launches, SSH, requests and log collection.
Python parsing and reporting live in separate modules in `scripts/`, each with
a command-line entry point. They can also be imported without running a report.
Shared helpers include:

- `site_env.py`: shared site settings from `.env` and deployment resolution;
  Bash callers use `cluster_env.sh`.
- `serve_streams.py`: saved SSE events, committed text, tool-call reconstruction
  and shutdown summaries.
- `forward_check_report.py`: the cross-rank digest and argmax checks used by both
  the Qwen and GLM forward-check scripts.
- `serve_pace.py`: per-request pace measurements, used directly by
  `width_sweep_collect.py` as well as its own CLI.

The remaining report modules cover admission, load phases, prefill, node probes,
RoCE counters and failure drills. To re-read saved results without launching a
cluster, for example, run `python3 scripts/serve_streams.py summary STREAM.sse`
or `python3 scripts/forward_check_report.py LOG_DIR 4`. Use `--help` on the report
modules to see their arguments. Their offline regression tests run with
`python3 tests/python/script_reports_test.py` or CTest's `script_reports_test`.

| `glm_gen_check --model ID --chat TEXT [--system S] --steps N [--decode-graph] [--mtp]` | generation on the fabric (or `--text`, `--prompt IDS`): resident TP, distributed greedy pick, EOS stop; `--decode-graph` replays the step as one CUDA graph, `--mtp` adds speculative decode (`docs/mtp.md`); `--requests FILE` runs a JSONL manifest through the scheduler, `--sched-plan` prints the memory receipt without a GPU, `--teacher-file F` scores a text instead of generating, `--sampling-profile` adds the exact top-k-mass sizing probe, `--sample` (or any of `--temperature --top-p --top-k --min-p --repetition-penalty`, with `--seed N`) samples exactly at the checkpoint's defaults on the eager engines (with `--mtp`: the eager exact speculative sampler) instead of the default greedy loop, and `--step-timing` prints the per-phase budget |
| `dgpp-serve --model ID --port P [--world W --rank R --peer HEAD --journal-port J] [--max-concurrency N --kv-capacity T --queue-limit Q] [--decode-graph [--mtp] --graph-batch-min-live N] [--temperature X --top-p X --top-k N --min-p X --repetition-penalty X --seed N] [--sampling-candidates N] [--admission full|grow --admission-window N] [--reasoning-in-content]` | the OpenAI-compatible service: `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/models`, `/health`, `/metrics` (JSON counters, also at `/v1/metrics`); rank 0 is the HTTP ingress and journals admissions to the peers; sampling defaults come from the checkpoint's `generation_config.json` (temperature 1.0 / top_p 0.95 for GLM-5.3-Flash-FP8) with the flags overriding them per process, requests may set `temperature`, `top_p`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `seed`, `top_k`, `min_p`, `repetition_penalty`, `logprobs` and `top_logprobs` (exact, the OpenAI shapes), and `/v1/models` reports the effective defaults; chat requests may carry `tools`, `tool_choice` (`auto`/`none`/`required`/a named function) and `parallel_tool_calls` — every call is well-formed by constrained decoding, a grammar mask on the pick applied identically on every rank (DESIGN §10): a declared function name, the argument keys the schema declares — every key closed to its `properties` whenever the schema declares any and does not opt out with an explicit `additionalProperties: true`, which is noted once naming the tool, and never the same key twice — argument values typed by their property schema (JSON-typed properties under the JSON machine — numeric `minimum` / `maximum` / `exclusiveMinimum` / `exclusiveMaximum` enforced digit by digit — enum strings from their texts, plain strings free; `function.strict: true` refuses a property outside the enforceable subset by keyword, a non-strict one under a keyword that only narrows its value without an automaton behind it — `pattern`, `format`, ... — keeps its type with one INFO line naming the keyword and the reason), and required, named and single-call turns as guarantees — `response_format` (`text` / `json_object` / `json_schema` with `name`, `schema`, `strict`: the content is one JSON text conforming to the schema's `type`, `properties` / `required` / `additionalProperties`, `items` / `minItems` / `maxItems`, `enum` / `const`, `anyOf`, and numeric `minimum` / `maximum` / `exclusiveMinimum` / `exclusiveMaximum`, enforced by the same masks; a strict schema outside that subset is refused naming the keyword, a non-strict one falls back to `json_object`; combinable with `tools`: auto chooses calls or a JSON answer, none forces JSON, required/named still require calls), `reasoning_effort`, `chat_template_kwargs` (`clear_thinking`, `reasoning_effort`), assistant `tool_calls` and `tool` messages, all rendered through the checkpoint's template, and the response carries `reasoning_content` (or, with `--reasoning-in-content`, the reasoning folded into `content`), `content` and `tool_calls` parsed from the token ids on rank 0 with `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` (DESIGN §11); the eager engines and the `--decode-graph` graphs, with or without `--mtp`, sample exactly (DESIGN §10, the on-device verdict with the gather fallback between windows; under MTP the exact speculative accept test, DESIGN §9); graph mode requires the fabric and `max-concurrency * (mtp ? 2 : 1) <= 8`, warm-captures every graph variant at startup (the journal's `warm` record starts it on every rank together), and batches at `--graph-batch-min-live` live requests (default min(4, max-concurrency); must be in [1, max-concurrency]) |
| `scripts/fabric_run.sh [--stage-file F] [--fetch-logs] [--node-probe] -- APP-ARGS` | launches any app on the four-node fabric with the rendezvous discipline (head first, peers fire-and-forget, verified by pgrep, swept on head death); collects rank-invariant md5s and bus stats |
| `scripts/serve_run.sh up/down/status` | boots/stops the serving world (`DGPP_SERVE_KNOBS` overrides the engine flags on every rank, e.g. `--max-concurrency 1 ... --decode-graph --mtp`); `down` fetches and md5s every rank's op stream |
| `scripts/serve_api_check.py HOST PORT` (the request fields against a running world), `scripts/serve_soak_run.sh MINUTES OUT`, `scripts/serve_failure_drill.sh VICTIM`, `scripts/serve_prefix_curve_sweep.sh`, `scripts/fabric_prefill_repeat.sh`, `scripts/fabric_mtp_classes.sh` | the M9 evidence procedures: the mixed-workload soak with node probes and the four-way md5, the kill −9 drill, the prefix cache's capacity curve, the steady-state prefill per length, MTP acceptance per prompt class (`docs/operations.md`) |
| `scripts/roce_counters.sh snapshot\|diff` | the fabric's RoCE hardware counters (sequence errors, adaptive retransmissions, CNPs, NIC ingress discards) per node and device, and the deltas between two snapshots — the wire-side view of a collective run |
| `scripts/serve_load.py HOST PORT [--concurrency 1,2,4] [--max-tokens N]`, `scripts/fabric_glm4_load.sh CONFIG OUT [--concurrency ...] [--tokens N]` | the fixed-concurrency decode reading (2026-09-10): c streaming long-answer requests at once per phase (thinking off, greedy), the client's per-request pace and aggregate tokens/s, and rank 0's stats lines inside each phase (the procedure boots the world with a 5-second stats line) — the batched depth-2 study's table |
| `scripts/serve_bench.py HOST PORT MAX_TOKENS LABEL [PROMPT]`, `scripts/serve_pace.py RANK_LOG [--waves]` | the service's pace: client-side SSE stamps; server-side per-request pace (from the per-token lines: run the service with `DGPP_LOG_LEVEL=debug`); and, with `--waves`, the steady peak-occupancy replay latency, tokens/replay, and aggregate tok/s used by the Phase-2 gate |
| `scripts/fabric_xcript.py`, `scripts/fabric_logprob.py`, `scripts/fabric_sampling_profile.py`, `scripts/fabric_xrank.py` | the judges (first divergence by bf16-ulp margin; teacher-forced perplexity delta; sampling-width evidence) and the cross-rank step/stall reader — `docs/numerics.md` |
| `scripts/step_probe.py [--max-tokens N] short|short+tools|long|ctx:N ...` | the decode-step probe against a running service: ttft, client ms/token, the engine's ms/step and tokens per step, the admission count, per mode |
| `scripts/mtp_depth_check.py --out DIR` | the greedy transcript of three prompts (prose, code, JSON) from a running service into DIR, for `diff -r` across launches (plain / MTP depth 1 / depth 2 / pipelined must be byte-identical) |
| `scripts/bus_window_skew.py LOG...` | the per-rank collective budget (copy / handshake / skew / fold) from the bus's window timeline lines (`DGPP_BUS_TIMELINE=1`) |

The GDR probe exits successfully when the probe itself completes, including
the expected “unsupported” result on GB10. It does not prescribe a bounce
copy; CollectiveBus uses registered pinned memory consumed directly by the
GPU.

Chat `reasoning_effort` accepts `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high` and
`xhigh`, either at the top level or in `chat_template_kwargs`. The Qwen
frontend maps minimal to low and high to xhigh; low, medium and xhigh pass
through. Qwen's checkpoint template adds short/extended thinking instructions
for low/xhigh, while medium uses its neutral thinking prompt. Other model
families receive the requested name unchanged and apply their own template.
