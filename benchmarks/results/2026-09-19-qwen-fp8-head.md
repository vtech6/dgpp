# Qwen FP8 vocabulary-head dispatch

## Scope

Prepared on `codex/fp8-vocabulary-head` from upstream
`444441feed0c4d7c256ff7ff7868b587823b737f`.

The FP8 vocabulary head opts into the existing streaming tensor-core kernel
above `dense_gemv_rows()` when the rows fit `max_decode_rows_`. The default
threshold is four: supported, aligned heads at five through sixteen rows
can reuse weight tiles instead of rereading them per GEMV chunk. Small
heads and heads above the configured decode-row ceiling retain the old
lowering. Short prefill calls within the interval are also affected because
the head is shared. Existing kernel eligibility checks retain fallback for
unsupported shapes. `DGPP_DENSE_GEMV_ROWS=256` provides the old head lowering
for supported decode rows.

This changes FP32 accumulation order, not weight quantization or logit
storage. It does not raise the decode-row ceiling, alter prefill chunking,
change the BF16 head, or add telemetry or deployment settings.

## Tests added

- `scale_gemm_f32_fp8_head_numerics`: K=2560, ragged N=257/4097, rows 4/5/8/16;
  compare unrounded FP32 logits to FP64 accumulation of BF16-rounded
  dequantized weights, plus same-shape bitwise repeatability and GEMV control.
  N=4097 uses the same eight-warp specialization as the production TP2
  vocabulary head. For its MMA cases, captured graph inspection requires
  one streaming kernel with a 256-thread block before executing it. The
  exhaustive oracle includes the ragged final block; this is specialization
  coverage, not a full-sized production vocabulary or checkpoint test.
- `qwen_decode_fp8_head`: teacher-forced fixture at 4/6/8/12/16 rows,
  capturing and replaying the target graph. Inspect the kernel that writes
  the vocabulary-logit buffer to require streaming MMA above the threshold.
  This dispatch assertion fails with the old head. Existing logit/near-tie
  checks and the 0.02-nat mean-NLL bound cover the resulting predictions.
  The default-threshold lane also compares short-prefill logits at lengths
  1/4/5/8/16/17 with a model whose four-row decode ceiling retains the old
  head dispatch. Both models retain the same dense lowering threshold;
  their final hidden states must be nonempty and bitwise equal. Eight
  prompts per length check finite logits, relative L2, top-1/near-ties,
  mean NLL delta per length, same-shape bitwise repetition, and bitwise
  logits outside the optimized interval.
- `qwen_decode_fp8_head_row_independent`: the same FP8 checks with the
  threshold at 256, requiring no streaming head.
- `qwen_engine_fp8_head_4` and `qwen_engine_fp8_head_256`: FP8 versions of
  the two-rank wide MTP slot-reuse/continuation fixture, including the
  existing exact transcript checks in the row-independent lane.

The FP8 loader setting is scoped to each test's model construction and
restored afterwards. No new public configuration or request fields are added.

## Validation on 2026-09-20

The contribution guide and numerical policy were re-read. Preparation on
x86 cross-compiled all affected translation units for AArch64/SM121a.
The reserved two-Spark window then ran a fresh native `ci` configure and
full build on GB10 with CUDA 13. GPU/RDMA checks ran serially after both
production ranks stopped, never alongside production serving.

The tested source was `ec829b24f317ca430d01233524a15de911f0440e` plus the
runtime graph-inspection fix in this record. The tested `qwen_decode_test.cpp`
SHA256 is `7f7b29813d82b8a50c733d5eba37b9aa0bf2ef3d6952dd1c196d2fd07c22e2c8`.
The optimization itself was unchanged during validation.

An isolated review of `5ed96cf` found missing assertions for the eight-warp
kernel and short-prefill logits; the follow-up tests now run successfully.
The first focused hardware run exposed an inspection issue: a driver-loaded
kernel in the captured graph returned `cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction` from
`cudaGraphKernelNodeGetParams`. The test now skips that unsupported runtime
query, clears its error, and still requires the statically linked FP8 head
kernel. Other errors remain fatal. A full native rebuild preceded rerunning.

- [Focused gates](2026-09-19-qwen-fp8-head/raw/focused-ctest.txt): all six
  selected tests passed, including the fixture generator, both decode lanes,
  both FP8 MTP loopback lanes, and `scale_gemm_test`.
- [Full suite](2026-09-19-qwen-fp8-head/raw/full-ctest.txt): 105 passed,
  zero failed, ten checkpoint-dependent skips; 653.52 seconds. The skip list
  is retained in the log and is not counted as model validation.
- [Negative control](2026-09-19-qwen-fp8-head/raw/negative-ctest.txt): replace
  only `src/models/qwen/forward.cpp` with upstream parent `444441f`, rebuild,
  and run the new test. It fails on the expected head-dispatch assertion.
  Restore the candidate source and rebuild: the
  [same test passes](2026-09-19-qwen-fp8-head/raw/candidate-recheck.txt).
- FP8 teacher-forced fixture: 368 rows, worst relative logit L2 `0.0023704`,
  zero top-1 near-ties, mean NLL delta `5.4114e-05` nat. Row-independent
  control: zero L2 and zero NLL delta.
- Short-prefill comparisons: mean NLL delta `2.52229e-08` nat at length 16,
  zero at lengths 1/4/5/8/17. Finite-logit, hidden-state equality, top-1,
  bitwise repeatability and unchanged-boundary assertions all passed.

### Production-size kernel measurement

The [standalone probe](2026-09-19-qwen-fp8-head/raw/head-bench.cpp) links the
native CI kernel library. It uses synthetic weights and activations at the
real TP2 vocabulary-head dimensions, N=124160 and K=2560. Five alternating
pairs of twenty products report median CUDA-event time after warming both
paths. The matrix exceeds L2. This measures the head, not end-to-end serving,
and is not a Release-build throughput claim.

| Rows | GEMV chunks, ms | Candidate dispatch, ms | Ratio |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 1.936709 | 1.952592 | 0.9919 |
| 4 | 1.939854 | 1.936296 | 1.0018 |
| 5 | 3.885965 | 1.824350 | 2.1301 |
| 8 | 3.919661 | 1.913115 | 2.0488 |
| 12 | 5.878384 | 1.960000 | 2.9992 |
| 16 | 7.857568 | 1.994789 | 3.9390 |

[Raw output](2026-09-19-qwen-fp8-head/raw/head-bench.txt). All output logits
were finite and equal to the GEMV control for these synthetic inputs;
sampled columns across every row, scale/block boundaries and the shard tail
also agreed exactly with FP64. The randomized exhaustive FP64 fixture is
separate; exact agreement on this synthetic probe is not a claim of general
bitwise equivalence between GEMV and MMA.

### Two-node serving and restoration

A separate explicit deployment configuration ran the candidate native CI
binary with `nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`, FP8 dense weights, concurrency
4, MTP depth 3, decode graphs, BF16 KV and a 1-GiB prefix cache.
[All nine API checks passed](2026-09-19-qwen-fp8-head/raw/candidate-serving-api.txt).
Shutdown used the same configuration; both participating ranks produced
op-stream MD5 `095726af690de19ef6cc93c953a00c16`.

Both production ranks were restored to their original release and unchanged
configuration. Their binary SHA256 remained
`ab1b88a00de32dedb0de63d285e584651d69c99185c106c4e6d7e549b9585fae`.
The service reported no engine failure and an empty queue. Both smoke
requests returned `READY`; the repeated 1137-token prompt reused 1128 tokens,
and the cache retained its configured 148 slots.

The maintenance wrapper restored production on both preliminary failures:
a self-SSH host-key check was replaced with a local process check, and the
runtime graph-inspection issue above was fixed before the successful run.
Full local operational logs remain under `artifacts/fp8-head/server-validation/`.

## Remaining evidence

Native execution, the complete available suite, the negative control,
production-size kernel timing and two-node API/op-stream checks are complete.
The subsequent [Release-build end-to-end comparison](2026-09-20-qwen-fp8-head-e2e.md)
measured 11.26% higher C4/MTP3 request-wall throughput on the fixed five-class
workload, with C1 effectively unchanged. Greedy transcripts varied within
the baseline as well as across builds; the record retains that limitation.
Matched real-checkpoint teacher-forced comparisons covering wide verification
rows and short prefill remain outstanding. Fixture NLL, throughput and the
serving API smoke are not substitutes for that numerical comparison.

PR creation remains intentionally on hold. No production release was updated.
