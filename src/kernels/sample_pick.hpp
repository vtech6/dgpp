// The on-device SAMPLING pick (DESIGN §10, the device path): the greedy
// pick's two kernels (glm_pick.hpp) generalized from top-1 to top-k per
// rank plus each slice's temperature-scaled log-sum-exp, and a verdict that
// makes sample::sample_from_prefix's decision BIT FOR BIT on the device
// — or flags the fallback for the host's exact gather. The host oracle is
// the definition; everything here mirrors its arithmetic: the same
// penalties (fused frequency step), the same fp32 temperature division, the
// same chunked normalizer order, the same deterministic exp/log
// (common/det_math.hpp), the same fp32 selector and fp64 walk, the same
// counter RNG. glm_pick_test pins the mirror against the host, value by
// value and bit by bit.
//
// Wire table: [rows][world][group] then the digest group [world][9] (the
// greedy pick's), even-padded. A rank's group is its k candidates (fp32
// logit bits as six digits, id as three — unused candidate slots carry the
// EMPTY id, an id no vocabulary reaches) followed by its slice lse (fp64
// bits as eleven digits). A greedy row writes one candidate (its canonical
// argmax) and no lse; a padding row writes nothing but zeros.
//
// Two shapes: T=1 (one row per request: accepted 1, next the decision)
// and the MTP T=2 verify (rows [next, draft] per request): row 0 accepts
// the draft with its exact probability or samples the residual
// (sample::spec_accept_from_prefix), and when the draft stands row 1
// is sampled as any step's token (sample_from_prefix) — so accepted is 2
// or 1 and next = winners[accepted-1], the greedy judge's shape. A row
// that cannot decide inside its prefix flags the fallback: row 0 by
// provisionally REJECTING (the commit then keeps only the post-row-0
// state, which is right for a reject and recoverable for an accept), row 1
// by feeding its provisional argmax; the host serves both between windows
// (GlmGraphEngineAdapter). The request's count table holds the tokens
// committed through the previous step: the local kernels read it with the
// step's fed tokens added per row (row 1 sees the draft), never writing
// it, and the verdict commits — the consumed token always, the draft only
// when it stood (sample::SampledSpeculator's context rule).
