// The distributed greedy pick's DEVICE half (DESIGN §9, the on-device
// step): the per-rank local argmax, the wire encoding the bus's SUM
// all-reduce turns into a gather, and the verdict every rank decodes from
// the folded table. No bus dependency — the collective between the two
// kernels is the caller's (DevicePicker in engine/tp_bus.hpp records
// it as a graph node or runs it eagerly).
//
// Wire table: [rows + 1][world][kPickSlotsPerRank] bf16 slots holding 6-bit
// digits (bf16 carries small integers exactly, and every slot has exactly
// one nonzero contributor, so the fp32-accumulated fold is exact). Group r
// < rows is row r's candidates — rank k's fp32 logit bits (6 digits) and
// vocab id (3 digits) in slots [r*world + k]; group `rows` is each rank's
// DIGEST of its previous verdict (9 digits, 54 bits). The digest is the
// readback invariant of the old host pick, one step late: every rank
// folds an identical table and so computes an identical verdict — a rank
// whose table was corrupt (the 2026-09-01 fabric race) computes a
// different one, and every rank sees its odd digest at the next pick.
//
// Order: canonical (logit desc, id asc), the sampler's candidate_before —
// glm_pick_local's top-2 is bitwise sample::local_max plus the
// runner-up the gen log prints, and glm_pick_verdict's merge is
// merge_greedy. NaN logits are unspecified (the host scan keeps a NaN at
// index 0, a tree reduction never does; a NaN logit is a broken model).
